## *About Me*

I am a graduate student studying Data Science at the University of Washington, with a focus on Machine Learning. My skillset extends beyond backend development and computer science fundamentals to include expertise in machine learning and deep learning.

I discovered Python a few years ago and have since developed a passion for programming. I enjoy working on everything from simple if-else statements to advanced object-oriented programming concepts. I take pride in my ability to create both simple and advanced projects using Python.

I have a solid understanding of front-end web development technologies, including HTML, CSS, and the Bootstrap framework. I have also used the **Flask** web framework to build responsive web pages. I have leveraged this knowledge to build both simple and complex machine learning models, and to display them effectively on the web.

My expertise in machine learning covers both supervised and unsupervised techniques. I have experience using simple **linear regression** as well as more advanced **Ensemble techniques** such as **bagging, boosting, and stacking**. I have also worked with XGBoost in some models, and have used k-means clustering in others. I feel well-equipped to work on machine learning projects in any domain, and am always eager to come up with new ideas to solve problems using ML.
