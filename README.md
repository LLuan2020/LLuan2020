## *About Me*

I am a graduate Data Science student at the University of Washington. I happen to posses the skillset of a backend developer with my primary aim in Data Science and Machine Learning .

I stumbled across python few years ago and since then I have fallen in love with the language and programming itself. From simple if else statements to advanced concepts of oops , from simple programs of python to making advanced projects in python , I have thoroughly enjoyed programming and I am proud of it . 

I also have the required knowledge of frontend like html,css and have worked with various frameworks like Bootstrap for creating responsive webpages and **flask** which is the web framework in python . All this knowledge has helped me in creating some simple , some complex **machine learning models** and displaying them over the web pages . 

My machine learning knowlege consists of both supervised and unsupersvised machine learning , from using simple **linear regression** to using **Ensembling techniques** consisting of **bagging,boosting and stacking** , using XGboost in some models while making clusters using k-means with some other models, i have a good knowledge
of machine learning projects , I can say that i am ready to work in any given domain , thinking of new Ideas to solve problems with ML.
